# JFKReveal - JFK Assassination Document Analysis

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE ⚠️**  
> **This is a preliminary test version based on only a small sample (4 pages out of 7,000) of the JFK assassination documents. The analysis is incomplete and should not be considered accurate or comprehensive. A full version analyzing all declassified documents is currently in development and will be published when complete.**

## Overview

JFKReveal is a tool that analyzes declassified documents from the National Archives to uncover evidence about the JFK assassination using advanced AI techniques and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Analysis Reports

## Data Sources

**TEST VERSION NOTE:** The current analysis is based on only 4 pages of documents from the National Archives JFK Collection, representing a tiny fraction of the available materials (approximately 7,000 pages in total). This version should be considered a technical demonstration only, not an accurate or comprehensive analysis.

The documents were processed using AI to extract information, identify patterns, and generate insights. A complete analysis of all 7,000 pages is currently in progress and will be published when available.

## Methodology

Our analysis pipeline includes:

1. Document collection from National Archives
2. Text extraction with page references
3. Semantic search using vector embeddings
4. AI analysis with OpenAI models
5. Comprehensive report generation

## Disclaimer

**⚠️ LIMITED TEST SAMPLE:** This current version was created using only 4 out of 7,000 pages of JFK-related documents as a technical proof of concept. The findings are NOT accurate, comprehensive, or representative of the full document collection.

**COMING SOON:** All JFK-related documents are currently being processed, and a complete analysis will be published when finished. Please consider this version only as a demonstration of the methodology and technical approach.

This tool is designed for educational and research purposes only. Even when the full version is complete, all findings should be critically evaluated alongside other historical research.
