## Overview

The investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy has been conducted through a comprehensive analysis of declassified documents, including CIA, FBI, and Warren Commission records, as well as eyewitness testimonies and forensic evidence. The purpose was to identify inconsistencies, potential cover-ups, and credible theories regarding the assassination. The methodology involved cross-referencing multiple sources to ensure factual accuracy and objectivity.


## Significant Evidence

- Lee Harvey Oswald's presence at the Texas School Book Depository during the assassination is well-documented, with multiple sources confirming his location ([Warren Commission Report](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report)).
- The Zapruder film provides crucial visual evidence of the sequence of events, supporting both the single-bullet theory and the possibility of multiple shooters ([Zapruder Film Analysis](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/zapruder-film)).
- Autopsy reports reveal discrepancies in the number and location of bullet wounds, raising questions about the official narrative ([Autopsy Report](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/autopsy-report)).

## Potential Government Involvement

- Documents suggest potential suppression of information regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's connections to intelligence agencies, with redacted sections hinting at withheld surveillance details ([CIA Documents](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/cia-documents)).
- The Warren Commission's reliance on potentially compromised FBI and CIA information has been criticized, suggesting a possible cover-up ([Warren Commission Criticism](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-criticism)).

## Most Credible Theories

- The theory of Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone is supported by the Warren Commission, though it is contested by other evidence suggesting multiple shooters ([Warren Commission Report](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report)).
- The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded a probable conspiracy, citing acoustic evidence of a second gunman ([HSCA Report](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/hsac-report)).

## Likely Culprits

- Lee Harvey Oswald is the most likely culprit based on his presence at the crime scene and prior suspicious activities, though his lone involvement is debated ([Warren Commission Report](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report)).

## Alternative Suspects

- Mafia figures such as Carlos Marcello and Santo Trafficante are considered alternative suspects due to their motives and alleged involvement in discussions about the assassination ([Mafia Involvement Documents](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/mafia-documents)).
- The possibility of Cuban intelligence involvement is suggested by Oswald's reported visits to the Cuban embassy and alleged connections ([Cuban Connection Documents](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/cuban-documents)).

## Patterns of Redaction

- Redactions are prevalent in documents related to intelligence agencies' surveillance of Oswald, suggesting withheld information about his activities and connections ([CIA Documents](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/cia-documents)).
- Key documents related to the Mafia and Cuban connections have missing files or redacted names, indicating possible suppression of evidence ([Mafia and Cuban Documents](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/mafia-cuban-documents)).

## Document Credibility Assessment

The overall credibility of the documents is medium, with numerous redactions and missing files raising questions about completeness. While some documents provide clear evidence, others are inconclusive or suggest potential suppression of information. Further investigation is necessary to resolve these issues.
