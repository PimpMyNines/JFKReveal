## Code Organization Guide

### Key Module Responsibilities

1. **scrapers/archives_gov.py**:
   - Handles downloading of PDF documents from National Archives
   - Uses backoff with retry, jitter, and proper error handling
   - Consider using a download cache to avoid redundant downloads

2. **database/document_processor.py**:
   - Extracts text from PDFs using PyMuPDF
   - Applies OCR using pytesseract when needed
   - Splits documents into chunks for embedding
   - Current OCR implementation is basic but functional

3. **database/text_cleaner.py**:
   - Cleans and normalizes extracted text
   - Handles OCR artifacts and common errors
   - Contains special case handling for test scenarios
   - Needs enhancements for historical document artifacts

4. **database/vector_store.py**:
   - Creates and manages ChromaDB for document embeddings
   - Handles embedding creation and storage
   - Provides semantic search capabilities

5. **analysis/document_analyzer.py**:
   - Uses LangChain and OpenAI to analyze document content
   - Executes various analysis tasks on the document content
   - Produces structured analysis output

6. **summarization/findings_report.py**:
   - Generates reports from analysis results
   - Uses LangChain for structured output generation
   - Creates HTML and Markdown reports

### Project Pipeline Flow

The data flows through the system as follows:
```
PDF Documents → Text Extraction (with OCR) → Chunking → Embedding → 
Vector Database → Semantic Search → Analysis → Report Generation
```

Each stage has specific configuration options that can be controlled through the command line interface or environment variables.

## Test Organization Progress

The test suite has been organized into three distinct directories, each with clear documentation:

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): 
   - Tests individual components in isolation
   - Mocks external dependencies
   - Focuses on class and function behavior

2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`):
   - Tests interactions between two or more components
   - Validates data flow between components
   - Ensures contracts between interfaces are maintained

3. **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`):
   - Tests complete workflows from start to finish
   - Uses real dependencies when possible
   - Validates system behavior from a user's perspective
   - Conditionally run in CI to avoid hitting API rate limits

Each test directory includes a README.md with:
- Purpose and scope of tests
- What should be tested in that directory
- Commands to run the tests
- Guidelines for test structure

The CI pipeline in GitHub Actions is configured to run the tests accordingly, with E2E tests only running on the main branch to avoid API rate limits during development.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Library Choices Matter**:
   - Using established libraries like `backoff`, `tenacity`, and `Pydantic` saves significant time over custom implementations
   - LangChain provides built-in error handling, retries, and structured outputs that simplify LLM interactions

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Implement proper retry with backoff early in the development process
   - Use jitter to avoid thundering herd problems with API rate limits
   - Define clear exception hierarchies and handle specific exceptions differently

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Use environment variables and `.env` files for secrets and configuration
   - Create typed configuration objects (like our `ScraperConfig`) for better validation and documentation

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Pydantic models provide runtime validation and better documentation
   - Structured outputs from LLMs are more reliable when validated against a schema

5. **Testing**:
   - Test network-dependent code with small, isolated examples before full integration
   - Create mock responses for testing to avoid hitting real APIs
   - Test failure modes (timeouts, rate limits) as well as success paths

6. **UI Design Best Practices**:
   - Use CSS variables for consistent color schemes and easy theme changes
   - Implement responsive design with media queries for mobile compatibility
   - Create card-based layouts for better organization of related content
   - Use visual hierarchy with clear headings, spacing, and typography
   - Include navigation aids like table of contents and back buttons

7. **LLM Prompt Engineering**:
   - Frame prompts with specific roles (e.g., detective) to get appropriately styled responses
   - Include detailed output structure requirements in the prompt
   - Break complex analysis into logical sections with clear expectations
   - Provide specific format instructions (Markdown with headers, etc.)
   - Include fallback mechanisms when structured output fails

8. **Working with Historical Documents**:
   - OCR quality varies significantly depending on document quality and type
   - JFK documents include typewritten memos, handwritten notes, and printed materials
   - Proper OCR and text cleaning is critical for meaningful analysis
   - Consider custom preprocessing for specific document types
   - Build test cases with representative samples of actual documents

9. **Development Workflow Best Practices**:
   - Always check existing functionality before implementing new features
   - Run grep/search tools across the codebase to find relevant implementations
   - Review unit tests to understand expected behaviors
   - Use BatchTool for parallel operations whenever possible
   - Document any discovered issues for future reference
   - When fixing tests, focus on proper mocking techniques:
     - Use patch.object instead of general patching for better control
     - Ensure mock objects satisfy model validation requirements
     - Keep mocking patterns consistent across similar tests
     - Make test failures informative by using descriptive assertions

## Architecture Notes

The project follows a pipeline architecture:
1. **Scraping**: Downloads PDF documents with retry capability
2. **Processing**: Extracts text from PDFs and splits into chunks
3. **Vectorization**: Creates embeddings and stores in ChromaDB
4. **Analysis**: Analyzes documents using OpenAI/LangChain
5. **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports from analysis

Each component can be run independently using the appropriate flags.

## PDF Processing and OCR

### OCR Implementation

The PDF text extraction system includes robust OCR capability particularly optimized for historical documents:

1. **Current Implementation**:
   - Integrated OCR using PyMuPDF for text extraction with pytesseract as OCR fallback
   - Smart image-based page detection for targeted OCR application
   - Command-line controls for OCR behavior (--no-ocr, --ocr-resolution, --ocr-language)
   - Specialized text cleaning for historical typewritten documents
   - Resolution scaling controls for quality/speed tradeoffs
   - Metadata tracking of OCR-processed pages and coverage percentages

2. **OCR-Specific Features**:
   - Fix typewriter artifacts common in JFK documents:
      - Margin alignment and centering issues
      - Underlined text recognition
      - Mixed spacing and tab handling
      - Character misinterpretations (1/I, 0/O, etc.)
   - JFK-specific term recognition:
      - Common agencies (CIA, FBI, KGB, etc.)
      - Key individuals (Oswald, Kennedy, etc.)
      - Geopolitical entities of the era
   - Special handling for historical document formats:
      - Document classification markings
      - Page number and reference handling
      - Headers and footers removal
      - Line break and hyphenation fixes

3. **Dependency Requirements**:
   - Tesseract OCR must be installed for OCR functionality
   - On macOS: `brew install tesseract`
   - On Ubuntu: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
   - On Windows: Download installer from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

4. **Performance Characteristics**:
   - OCR resolution scaling directly impacts quality and speed:
      - 1.0x: Fastest, lowest quality (suitable for high-quality scans)
      - 2.0x: Good balance (default setting)
      - 3.0x+: Highest quality, much slower (for poor quality documents)
   - Language settings impact recognition accuracy:
      - "eng" is the default and works well for JFK documents
      - Multiple languages can be specified for multilingual documents
   - Memory usage increases with resolution and page size

## Logging System
